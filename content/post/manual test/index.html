<p>manual test of post
a simple way to visualize or summarize monthly returns as well as average monthly returns using R. Interested readers can modify the instrument, period and length of time to their preference.</p>
<p>We start by installing the R packages that will be needed to produce libraries later. For more information about one of the key packages used here, the <code>tidyquant</code> package, see [2].</p>
<div id="getting-and-preparing-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Getting and Preparing Data</h2>
<p>We will get the data for the S&amp;P 500 Index, symbol = ^GSPC, from Yahoo! Finance. We will then prepare the data for visualization and/or Summarization of results as needed.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-markdown" class="section level2">
<h2>R Markdown</h2>
<p>This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com" class="uri">http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com</a>.</p>
<p>When you click the <strong>Knit</strong> button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(cars)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##      speed           dist       
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="including-plots" class="section level2">
<h2>Including Plots</h2>
<p>You can also embed plots, for example:</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/pressure-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Note that the <code>echo = FALSE</code> parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.</p>
